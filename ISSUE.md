# Debug Better Auth + Convex Authentication Issues

## Problem Overview

I'm experiencing authentication failures in my Next.js application using Better Auth with Convex backend. **CRITICAL**: This issue started immediately after adding Polar integration with Convex plugins - authentication was working perfectly before this change.

The issue manifests as:

1. **Primary Error**: `FAILED_TO_CREATE_USER` (HTTP 422) for all authentication methods
2. **Affected Auth Methods**: Email/password signup, Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth
3. **Only Working Account**: souravsspace@gmail.com (previously created before Polar integration)
4. **Trigger**: Issues started immediately after integrating Polar with Convex plugins

## Why Polar Integration Likely Caused This Issue

### Potential Root Causes:

1. **Schema Conflicts**:

   - Polar may have introduced conflicting database schemas
   - User table modifications that conflict with Better Auth schema
   - New required fields or constraints preventing user creation

2. **Plugin Interference**:

   - Convex plugins from Polar may be intercepting auth mutations
   - Middleware conflicts between Polar and Better Auth
   - Plugin initialization order causing auth handlers to fail

3. **Database Migration Issues**:

   - Polar integration may have altered existing user table structure
   - Migration scripts that modified Better Auth table constraints
   - Database state corruption during Polar setup

4. **Environment Variable Conflicts**:

   - New Polar environment variables overriding auth configurations
   - Plugin configuration interfering with Better Auth setup
   - API route conflicts between Polar and auth endpoints

5. **Dependency Conflicts**:
   - Version mismatches between Polar dependencies and Better Auth
   - Conflicting database adapters or ORM configurations
   - Plugin dependencies that modify global auth behavior

## Error Details

### Console Errors

```
XHR POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/sign-up/email [HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity]
ERROR: {
  code: "FAILED_TO_CREATE_USER",
  message: "Failed to create user",
  details: {},
  status: 422,
  statusText: "Unprocessable Entity"
}
```

### OAuth Errors

```
Better Auth Error: unable_to_create_user
Error Code: unable_to_create_user
```

### Router Warning

```
Warning: A notFoundError was encountered on the route with ID "/auth",
but a notFoundComponent option was not configured
```

## Environment Configuration

```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=start-starter-kit

## Architecture Notes

- Using Better Auth with Convex backend
- Better Auth schema is integrated into main Convex schema (no separate auth tables needed)
- Recently added Polar integration with Convex plugins
- TanStack Router for routing

## Tasks Required

### 1. **Investigate Auth API Route**

- Examine `/api/auth/sign-up/email` endpoint implementation
- Check if the route handler is properly configured for Better Auth
- Verify request/response flow and error handling

### 2. **Debug Convex Schema Integration**

- Review how Better Auth schema is integrated with main Convex schema
- Ensure user creation mutations are properly defined
- Check for schema conflicts after Polar integration

### 3. **Analyze OAuth Configuration**

- Verify Google/GitHub OAuth app configurations
- Check redirect URIs and domain settings
- Ensure OAuth providers are properly registered in Better Auth config

### 4. **Analyze Polar Integration Impact (HIGH PRIORITY)**

- **Review Polar installation steps** - identify what changed in the codebase
- **Check Convex plugins configuration** - look for conflicts with auth plugins
- **Examine schema changes** - compare pre/post Polar schema definitions
- **Identify plugin conflicts** - check if Polar plugins interfere with auth flow
- **Review Polar environment variables** - ensure no conflicts with auth config
- **Check database migrations** - verify if Polar modified user table structure
- **Test rollback scenario** - temporarily disable Polar to confirm it's the cause

### 5. **Fix Router Configuration**

- Configure proper `notFoundComponent` for `/auth` route
- Ensure auth routes are properly defined in TanStack Router

### 6. **Database State Investigation**

- Check existing user records in Convex database
- Verify if souravsspace@gmail.com account has special properties
- Look for database constraints preventing new user creation

## Debugging Approach (Polar-Focused)

1. **FIRST: Isolate Polar Impact** - temporarily disable/remove Polar integration to confirm it's the root cause
2. **Compare configurations** - diff the codebase before and after Polar integration
3. **Check Polar-specific logs** - look for Polar plugin errors or conflicts in console
4. **Examine plugin order** - ensure Polar plugins don't override auth plugins
5. **Review Convex schema changes** - compare schema before/after Polar installation
6. **Test incremental rollback** - remove Polar components one by one to isolate the problematic part
7. **Check Polar documentation** - verify if there are known conflicts with Better Auth
8. **Database state comparison** - check if Polar modified existing user records structure

## Expected Outcomes

- All authentication methods (email/password, Google, GitHub) working properly
- New users can successfully sign up and log in
- OAuth flows complete without errors
- Router warnings resolved

Please analyze the codebase systematically, starting with the auth API routes and Convex schema integration, then work through each authentication method to identify and fix the root cause of the user creation failures.
